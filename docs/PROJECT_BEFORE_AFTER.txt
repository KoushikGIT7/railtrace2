PROJECT BEFORE vs AFTER (SIMPLE LIST)

INITIAL (BEFORE)
- Basic React + Vite setup with Tailwind
- UI not mobile-friendly; cramped cards and overflow issues
- Reports section: plain layout, hard to scan on phones
- Blockchain Audit: long hashes overflowing; no copy; block numbers missing
- AI Analytics: unreliable Gemini JSON responses causing errors
- Mixed/unused UI elements (e.g., Browse Recent Part); some unused icons/imports
- Netlify deployment issues (submodule confusion; package.json not found)
- No reusable components for truncation/copy/skeleton states
- Real-time experience limited; charts not consistently populated

IMPROVEMENTS & INTEGRATIONS (AFTER)
- Mobile-first redesign across dashboard sections (clean spacing, rounded cards, shadows)
- Generate Report: stacked controls on mobile, large clear buttons, no overflow
- Generated Reports: new ReportCard component; responsive grid; clear status + one-tap download
- Blockchain Audit: compact cards with key:value rows, block numbers shown, hashes truncated + copy
- Removed “Browse Recent Part”; kept direct part-hash input only
- AI Analytics stabilized with mock-first data + real-time processing; JSON parse errors eliminated
- Reusable components added: TruncatedText, CopyButton, Skeleton, ReportCard (TypeScript)
- Real-time Firestore onSnapshot feeds stats and recent transactions; mock fills charts as fallback
- Netlify build fixed (removed backend submodule from frontend repo); Vite env vars standardized (VITE_*)
- Backend relayer hosted (Railway) and integrated via VITE_RELAYER_ENDPOINT
- Linter clean-up: unique keys, removed unused imports/icons, tidier types
